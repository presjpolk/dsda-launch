The Makefile will auto-detect your OS and work accordingly.  You will need Go
in your path, as well as the fyne command line tool installed into your path.

On Linux you will need the linuxdeploy appimage in your path or specify where
it is for making the appimage. See LINUXDEPLOY in the Makefile.  You will
probably also need a host of libraries installed, but that varies system by
system.

On Universal Blue-based systems such as Bazzite, create an Ubuntu distrobox and
build in that. Then you can just keep installing -devel libraries until the
thing builds.  The appimage you build in the Distrobox will run in your main
system just fine. At least, it did in my testing.
